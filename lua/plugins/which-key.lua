-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end

return {
  { -- Useful plugin to show you pending keybinds.
    'folke/which-key.nvim',
    event = 'VimEnter', -- Sets the loading event to 'VimEnter'
    opts = {
      window = {
        border = 'none', -- none, single, double, shadow
        position = 'bottom', -- bottom, top
        margin = { 1, 0, 1, 0 }, -- extra window margin [top, right, bottom, left]. When between 0 and 1, will be treated as a percentage of the screen size.
        padding = { 1, 2, 1, 2 }, -- extra window padding [top, right, bottom, left]
        winblend = 10, -- value between 0-100 0 for fully opaque and 100 for fully transparent
        zindex = 1000, -- positive value to position WhichKey above other floating windows.
      },
    },
    config = function(_, opts) -- This is the function that runs, AFTER loading
      require('which-key').setup(opts)
      -- visual mode
      require('which-key').register({
        ['<leader>h'] = { 'Git [H]unk' },
      }, { mode = 'v' })
    end,
  },
}
